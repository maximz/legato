in AccountController, when using Membership.GetUser() with or without any parameters, decide where to state whether user is online or not! this means whether to update the user's last activity time.
this applies to ForgotPassword(), ForgotUsername(), and all other such methods, as well as methods where we're getting information about a different user (admincontroller, accountcontroller).
