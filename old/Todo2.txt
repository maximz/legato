if you don't define a custom viewmodel, we'll just have to rework all the controller->view lines so that we don't use ViewData[], as the Model won't work. instead, do ViewData.Model = new List<stuff>() { blah, blah}; return View(); //http://stephenwalther.com/blog/archive/2009/04/13/asp.net-mvc-tip-50-ndash-create-view-models.aspx

4. EditViewModel - has ReviewRevisionViewModel, PianoVenueHourViewModel
