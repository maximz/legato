trying to imitate http://i.imgur.com/8dn1r.png:

"blue bkgd" swatch
text: open sans, 102.68pt - blackesque swatch, blue bkgd swatch
selected text (might need rasterization as a copied layer)
select -> modify -> border -> 40px
select -> modify -> feather -> 5px
new layer
fill selection with "faded white" swatch. rather than filling completely, just paintbucket three times : tolerance = 32, opacity = 100, mode = normal, anti-alias = on, contiguous = on, all layers = off

group layers in folder
align folder vertically, horizontally
