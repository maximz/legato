		<h1>Privacy Policy <small>for Legato Network Portal</small></h1>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="span12">

	<p>
		Legato Network Portal (the &ldquo;Portal&rdquo;, "Service") is a website owned and operated by Legato Network.
		(&ldquo;Legato Network&rdquo;, "Our", "We"). Legato Network
		takes the private nature of your personal information very seriously. This Privacy
		Policy describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit and use
		the Portal. Please read this notice very carefully before using the Portal.</p>
	<h2>
		Portal Visitors</h2>
	<p>
		Like most website operators, Legato Network collects non-personally-identifying
		information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available,
		such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and
		time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
		information is to better understand how the Portal visitors use the Service. From
		time to time, Legato Network may release non-personally-identifying information
		in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Portal.</p>
	<p>
		Legato Network also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
		Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Legato Network does not use such information to
		identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than
		under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information,
		as described below.</p>
	<h2>
		Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
	<p>
		Certain visitors to the Portal choose to interact with the Portal in ways that
		require Legato Network gather personally-identifying information. The amount and
		type of information that We gather depends on the nature of the interaction. For
		example, We ask visitors who sign up for legatonetwork.com to provide a username
		and email address. Those who engage in transactions with legatonetwork.com
		– by purchasing access to a service, for example – are asked to provide additional
		information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required
		to process those transactions. In each case, Legato Network collects such information
		only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor&rsquo;s
		interaction with the Service. Legato Network does not disclose personally-identifying
		information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply
		personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from
		engaging in certain Portal-related activities.</p>
	<h2>
		Aggregated Statistics</h2>
	<p>
		Legato Network may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the Portal.
		For instance, We may monitor the most popular content on the Portal to help identify
		spam. We may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However,
		Legato Network does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as
		described below.</p>
	<h2>
		Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
	<p>
		Legato Network discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
		information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations
		that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Our behalf or to
		provide services available at the Portal, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose
		it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations
		may be located outside of your home country; by using the Portal, you consent to
		the transfer of such information to them. In addition, in some cases we may choose
		to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically
		one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Legato Network or substantially
		all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Legato Network goes
		out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets
		that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers
		may occur, and that any acquiror of Legato Network may continue to use your personal
		and non-personal information only as set forth in this policy. Otherwise, Legato Network will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
		information to anyone.</p>
	<p>
		Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations or as described
		above, Legato Network discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
		information only when required to do so by law, or when We believe in good faith
		that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of 
		Legato Network, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of
		the Portal and have supplied your email address, Legato Network may occasionally
		send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just
		keep you up to date with what&rsquo;s going on with our Service. We primarily use
		our Service to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type
		of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email
		or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order
		to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
		Legato Network takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized
		access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
		personally-identifying information.</p>
	<p>
		You should also be aware that if you submit information to the Portal, such information
		becomes public information, meaning that you lose any privacy rights you might have
		with regards to that information. Such disclosures may also increase your chances
		of receiving unwanted communications.</p>
	<p>
		For users outside the United States, please note that any personally-identifiable
		information you enter into the Portal will be transferred out of your country and
		into the United States. You consent to such transfer through your use of the Portal.
		You also warrant that you have the right to transfer such information outside your
		country and into the United States.</p>
	<h2>
		Links to Third Party Sites</h2>
	<p>
		This Privacy Policy only applies to information collected by Legato Network. This
		Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Legato Network
		does not own or control, or employees that Legato Network does not manage. The Portal
		contains links to third party websites. Any information you provide to, or that
		is collected by, third-party sites may be subject to the privacy policies of those
		sites, if any. We encourage you to read such privacy policies of any third-party
		sites you visit. It is the sole responsibility of such third parties to adhere to
		any applicable restrictions on the disclosure of your personally-identifying information,
		and Legato Network and its affiliates shall not be liable for wrongful use or disclosure
		of your personally-identifying information by any third party.</p>
	<h2>
		Security</h2>
	<p>
		All non-personally-identifying information, potentially personally-identifying and
		personally identifying-information described above is stored on restricted database
		servers.</p>
	<h2>
		Choice/Opt-out</h2>
	<p>
		If we ever send you information by e-mail concerning new products, services or information
		that you did not expressly request, we will provide you with an e-mail address by
		which you may request no further notices.</p>
	<h2>
		Cookies</h2>
	<p>
		A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor&rsquo;s computer,
		and that the visitor&rsquo;s browser provides to the website each time the visitor
		returns. Legato Network uses cookies to help Us identify and track visitors, their
		usage of the Portal, and their Portal access preferences. Legato Network visitors
		who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers
		to refuse cookies before using the Portal, with the drawback that certain features
		of the Portal may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
	<h2>
		Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
	<p>
		Although most changes are likely to be minor, Legato Network may change its Privacy
		Policy from time to time, and in Legato Network's sole discretion. If we do then
		we&rsquo;ll notify you by posting the amended policy on the Portal or by emailing
		you of the nature of the modifications along with a link to the modified document
		so that you can review it. In all cases, use of information we collect now is subject
		to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.</p>
	<h2>
		Review and Access</h2>
	<p>
		Upon your request, we will provide you with a summary of the information we collect
		about you. You will have the opportunity to correct, update, modify or delete this
		information by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:hello@legatonetwork.com">hello@legatonetwork.com</a>.
		Please note that some information may remain in our records after deletion of your
		account.</p>
