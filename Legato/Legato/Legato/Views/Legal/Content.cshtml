	<p>
		The intent of this document is to clarify what we consider to be acceptable use
		of any website or service provided by Legato Network (collectively "Legato Network", "Portal").</p>
	<p>
		If you are found to be in violation of any of the below policies, you will receive
		a notice via email. Unless you explain or correct your behavior within 72 hours,
		your account will be suspended. We will do our best to work with you and ensure
		a fair outcome in all cases. We reserve the right to immediately suspend, without
		notice, any content, account, or IP address which we determine to be submitting
		spam or potentially other damaging or disruptive content the Portal.</p>
	<p>
		When your account is suspended, public access to content contributed under that
		account may be blocked or removed, and your account may be suspended or deleted
		at our discretion. Access to other functionality or information within the Portal
		may also be blocked or disabled.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Illegal Use.</b> Legato Network may not be used for illegal purposes. Examples
		of this include using Legato Network for fraudulent purposes or operating a phishing
		site (used to obtain account and password information).</p>
	<p>
		<b>Spam.</b> Users that do not publish meaningful content, use deceptive means to
		generate revenue or traffic, or whose primary purpose is affiliate marketing, will
		be suspended.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Identity Theft and Privacy.</b> Users that misleadingly appropriate the identity
		of another person are not permitted. Users may not post other people's personally
		identifying or confidential information, including but not limited to credit card
		numbers, Social Security Numbers, and driver's and other license numbers. You may
		not post information such as other people's passwords, usernames, phone numbers,
		addresses and e-mail addresses unless already publicly accessible on the Web.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Hate Content, Defamation, and Libel.</b> Hate speech and other objectionable
		content that is unlawful, defamatory, and fraudulent. Note that an allegation of
		defamatory expression, in and of itself, does not establish defamation. The truth
		or falsehood of a bit of expression is a key element in establishing defamation,
		and we are not in a position to make that sort of fact-based judgment. That said,
		if we have reason to believe that a particular statement is defamatory (a court
		order, for example), we will remove that statement.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Disruptions and Exploits.</b> We will terminate accounts and block addresses
		of those who attempt unauthorized use of Legato Network Portal.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Copyright.</b> Using copyrighted material does not constitute infringement in
		all cases. In general, however, users should be careful when using copyrighted content
		without the permission of those who created it. It is our policy to respond to notices
		of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA").</p>
	<p>
		<b>Mass Registration and Automation.</b> Accounts that are registered automatically
		or systematically will be removed and access will be permanently suspended.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Sexually Explicit Material.</b> Accounts that use Legato Network to post sexually
		explicit or pornographic material, or links to it, will be suspended.</p>
