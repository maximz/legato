Akismet report spam/spam checking + captcha!
	if a post fails the akismet spam check, show the captcha with two hidden fields in the view:
		a.) the content that the user submits is boxed into an object, serialized into xml, and then encrypted
		b.) the name of the action that the user was executing is also encrypted. sample values (registered in the action itself where the captcha is triggered and in the captcha form post action):
			- "edit"
			- "submit"
			- etc.

one time openid registration key - inside admin panel
	choose what roles they're applied to (cannot choose for ActiveUser and EmailNotConfirmed)
	choose whether to display a custom welcome name (name of recepient)
	whether to add openid into openid whitelist
instead of deleting all records from openid whitelist, set IsEnabled to false - also, in whitelist enabled db check, make sure to add where clause - where isenabled = true.
admin option: enable/disable openid whitelist, add openids to whitelist, remove openids from whitelist
